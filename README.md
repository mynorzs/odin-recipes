# odin-recipes

First exercise from The Odin Project.
This is a simple site that presents multiple recipes via links.

At completion of basic files, the structure consists of a primary site that links to recipes stored in another directory. In this exercise I decided to write the HTML 5 boiler-plate each time, because I want to build some muscle memory into my process.
