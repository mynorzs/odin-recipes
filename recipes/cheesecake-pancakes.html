      <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 3/4 cups all purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups buttermilk</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
      <li>Graham cracker crumbs or powdered sugar for topping</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        For topping, combine strawberries and jam in a small saucepan. Bring to
        a simmer; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        For cream cheese swirl, combine cream cheese, 3 tablespoons sugar, milk,
        and vanilla in a small bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer cream cheese mixture to a pastry bag or a resealable plastic
        bag with a corner snipped off.
      </li>
      <li>
        For pancake batter, combine flour, remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, baking
        powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>Combine egg, buttermilk, and oil in a medium bowl.</li>
      <li>
        Add egg mixture all at once to the flour mixture. Stir just until
        moistened (batter should be slightly lumpy).
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat an extra-large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Coat
        with cooking spray. Pour 1/3 cup portions of batter onto the skillet.
        Reduce heat to medium-low.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook until bottoms are golden brown and edges are slightly dry and
        bubbles form at the edges of the pancakes, 2 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pipe a swirl of cream cheese onto each pancake starting from the center.
      </li>
      <li>Coat the uncooked side of the pancakes with cooking spray.</li>
      <li>
        Turn and cook 2 to 3 minutes more on the other side. Repeat with
        remaining batter and cream cheese mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve with strawberry topping and sprinkle with graham cracker crumbs or
        dust with powdered sugar.
      </li>
    </ol>
